                Trippy Collective started just this January 2022. It began in 
                the Cardano space as an experiment on NFT&rsquo;s. Noticing that 
                there were an abundance of still image generative NFT&rsquo;s, a 
                niche was realized that animated/moving NFT&rsquo;s were few and far 
                between. What began as an idea about moving NFT&rsquo;s, then focused 
                on something that should instill joy and fight depression during this 
                dismal times. Hence the trippy background themes, funny looking tarsiers, 
                and the sexy/beautiful muses.

                Seeing that in Cardano, minting NFT&rsquo;s
                were costly with no assurance of sales in return, which led the
                author to search for another way into the NFT space. Opensea&rsquo;s
                Polygon minting was the answer to keep spreading this brand of NFT
                with it&rsquo;s free minting service and soon coupled with Cardano&rsquo;s
                NFT-Maker on-demand minting (removed the cost of minting from
                creators). Now, Trippy Collective is on both Cardano and Polygon
                networks. <br/>

              <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;">
                All NFT&rsquo;s of Trippy Collective are
                permanent to the Polygon and Cardano blockchain, can not be altered or deleted by the
                author once minted, beware that in Opensea Polygon many NFT&rsquo;s
                are not frozen metadata which means that they are not permanent to
                the Polygon blockchain, this means your NFT from them can suddenly
                change its looks, its attributes, or even get deleted.

                  Hoping that the collector community for Trippy Collective will grow organically 
                  which will open new windows of NFT use case. Evaluating how these NFT&rsquo;s 
                  are accepted will give way to other use case possibilities.

                <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;">
                  More likely maybe a move to put NFT&rsquo;s in Trippy Collective as a way to give back 
                  to worthy causes like Tarsier conservatories, and maybe laptops for a budding artist 
                  still in school (teens, to pre-teen aged talented artists) for example. 
                  All that depends on you, THE COMMUNITY.
