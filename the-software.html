                      Generative art requires some form of
                      automation in generating a large set of NFT assets with their
                      somewhat unique set of attributes per piece along with their
                      individual metadata. This is where the software comes into service.
                      There are a lot of software and even services you can pay for this
                      kind of output. The author chose the open source route since
                      programming and open source is the author&rsquo;s field of
                      experience.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;">	The program is from an open source
                      code, made using Node JS. The author had to test it, dismantle it,
                      and recode a lot of it since it was a very basic released version.
                      Currently in it&rsquo;s modified state it can use animated GIF
                      backgrounds mixed with PNG/JPEG still images and can now output two
                      kinds of metadata (Opensea Polygon type metadata, or Cardano type
                      metadata which can also be used for Opensea Polygon minting just
                      ignore the unnecessary sections of the metadata). More upgrades to
                      the software will be made as the need arises.<br/>

                      The software took 3 hours to generate all 500 Sexy Muses and around 4 to
                      5 hours to generate the 1000 Trippy Tarsiers. The NFT&rsquo;s were
                      generated on a simple gaming laptop running Node JS.
