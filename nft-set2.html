                  Sexy Muses is the second project officially released on Cardano, now
                  also in the Polygon network. This is a more limited release of only
                  500 muses on Polygon and 500 muses on Cardano, both network sets are
                  again identical. Resembling collectible cards some of us have grown
                  fond of collecting in our youth. Also used the same backgrounds from
                  the tarsier set with just an additional one more animated GIF
                  background. What&rsquo;s not to like, it&rsquo;s trippy, its
                  beautiful, and they are sexy.

                    named Hazzel who dreamed of modelling but never got around to getting
                    it done, in NFT space the author made her one and this is with full
