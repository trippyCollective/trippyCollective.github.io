                Funny looking tarsiers just having a trippy day, this is the first
                Cardano NFT project officially released by the author and now also in
                the Polygon network. There are only 1000 of this NFT&rsquo;s on
                Polygon, and also 1000 in Cardano, both sets on each network are
                identical. Trippy backgrounds sometimes complemented by the
                accessories on some of the tarsiers. The accessories or even
                variations on the background admittedly is quite limited, but
                nevertheless a fun and trippily beautiful random generated art.</p>

                Tarsier fact, they are endangered and in the Philippines they are
                mostly preserved by conservatory organizations. They do get depressed
                and commit suicide by hitting their heads on a hard object to death
                contributing to lesser numbers of living tarsiers. Trippy Tarsiers
                represent a fun and lively depiction of these endangered species, as
                a nod to the fact that they do get depressed and that they need to be
                protected from stress and man made causes of their demise.</p>
